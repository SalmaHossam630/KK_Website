        <h1 class="section-title">KK STORY</h1>
        <p class="section-text">SOME PEOPLE SAY THE HEART OF ANY NEW CITY IS ITS MUSEUMS, ITS BUSTLING CENTERS, ITS OLD BOOKSTORES, ITS NIGHTLIFE OR ITS FOOD. BUT WHENEVER I GO SOMEWHERE NEW. I ALWAYS FIND THE REAL HEART AND SOUL OF THE CITY AND THE PEOPLE IN IT TO BE IN ITS LITTLE CORNER CAFES. THE PLACES SO SEEMINGLY OBSCURE, YOU CAN WALK RIGHT PAST THEM. THE PLACES WHERE, WHEN YOU WALK IN, IT IS QUIET, IT IS QUALITY, DIFFERENT PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS. ALL UNITED IN THE SIMPLE ACT OF JUST BEING RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW, SIPPING THEIR COFFEE.</p>
        <p class="section-text">THE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE GO TO BE MOST THEMSELVES WHERE THEY GO TO SHED ALL THEIR LAYERS AND BECOME WHO THEY ARE AND IT GOT ME THINKING THAT THESE PLACES IN ALL DIFFERENT CITIES, DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, AND DIFFERENT CONTINENTS HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON. KOFFEE AND EVEN THOUGH EVERY CITY, COUNTY OR CONTINENT HAS ITS OWN CULTURE WITH ITS DIFFERENT TYPES OF COFFEE, AND THE DIFFERENT RITUALS SURROUNDING DRINKING COFFEE.</p>
        <h2 class="section-subtitle">KK KONCEPT</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            A PERSON’S COFFEE ORDER IS A UNIVERSAL TOOL THAT CAN BE USED</p>
            <p class="section-text1">TO FIGURE SOMEONE OUT!</p>
        <p class="section-text">
            CULTURES, VIBES AND RITUALS, (PARTICULARLY IF WE ARE DIFFERENT PEOPLE), OUR COFFEE CHOICES, FROM IT’S SCHEDULED TIME, TO IT’S ROAST LEVEL, TO THE AMOUNT AND TYPE OF MILK WE ADD, TO OUR CHOSEN TOPPINGS, THE WAY WE CHOOSE TO TRANSPORT IT AND THE WAY WE HOLD IT, ALL ARE SUCH A REGULAR PART OF OUR DAILY COMMUNICATION AND HABITS, AND CAN VIEW THE CHARACTERISTIC OF DIFFFERENT PEOPLE WITH THEIR DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS.....AND KULTURES.
            
            A READY TO GO 8:00 AM CUP THAT’S ABOUT TO SPILL FOR A BUSY WORKAHOLIC WHO IS RUSHING AND TRYING TO BALANCE CARRYING TWO BAGS WHILE HOLDING ONTO THEIR COFFEE - LIFELINE- CUP FOR LIFE BECAUSE THAT’S THE ONLY THING GETTING THEM THROUGH THEIR DAY, OR AN IN HOUSE CERAMIC MUG FOR A SILENT WRITER THAT LOVES THE SMELL OF COFFEE SHOPS,
            AND EARLY MORNINGS,
            MAYBE A SMALL ASAP ESPRESSO IN A TINY CUP FOR A BUSINESS MAN THAT NEEDS A SHARP TO THE BRAIN SHOT BEFORE A MEETING, AND WILL SIP IT LOUDLY DURING WITH TWO VERY ARROGANT FINGERS RAISED, IT COULD BE A MATCHA CAN FOR A MODERN TREND SETTER WHO LOVES TO ROMANTACIZE LIFE, OR A STRAW COVERED CUP THAT BARELY CONTAINS A SUGAR BOMB DRINK OOZING WITH CREAM AND SYRUP THAT MAKES A MORE “DESSERT LIKE DRINK”, THAN COFFEE.
            
            THIS IS WHAT A KOFFEE KULTURE IS:
